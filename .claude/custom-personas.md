## Persona Interaction Patterns

### Collaborative Decision Making
- **audio + realtime**: Voice conversation architecture decisions
- **podcast + python-node**: Content generation pipeline design
- **transcription + audio**: Provider selection and audio optimization
- **md3-ui + podcast**: Audio player component design
- **tdd-guard + ALL**: Quality validation across all features

### Conflict Resolution
1. **Performance vs Quality**: realtime persona leads for voice, podcast persona leads for content
2. **Complexity vs Maintainability**: tdd-guard persona enforces simplicity standards
3. **Feature scope**: Project timeline constraints override feature completeness

### Context Handoff
- Start with domain expert for technical decisions
- Include md3-ui for any user-facing components
- Always include tdd-guard for implementation validation
- Escalate architecture conflicts to system architect
